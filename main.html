    <p>	In this project, we will be analyzing various crime reports around the Boston area and more specifically, in which neighborhoods they occur, to provide additional insight to students who are looking for off-campus housing. With over 30 colleges and universities and 150,000 students, Boston is one of the largest college cities in the country, and with that comes thousands of students looking for housing each year. Although Boston is generally considered a safe city, it is still an urban area where crime does occur, and it is important to consider this when selecting a new place to live. Our project aims to help students who are not used to living in a city be aware of certain areas that may have higher rates of crime than others, and educate them in choosing housing in areas with lower crime rates.
