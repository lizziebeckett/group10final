    <p>	In this project, we will be analyzing various crime reports around the Boston area and more specifically, in which neighborhoods they occur, to provide additional insight to students who are looking for off-campus housing. With over 30 colleges and universities and 150,000 students, Boston is one of the largest college cities in the country, and with that comes thousands of students looking for housing each year. Although Boston is generally considered a safe city, it is still an urban area where crime does occur, and it is important to consider this when selecting a new place to live. Our project aims to help students who are not used to living in a city be aware of certain areas that may have higher rates of crime than others, and educate them in choosing housing in areas with lower crime rates. </p>
    <h4> Methodology </h4>
    <p>For our project, we’re using the 2024 Boston Crime Incident Reports dataset from the Boston open data portal. This dataset includes crime incidents reported from August 2015 to the present, sourced from the city’s new reporting system. The data contains details such as crime types, dates, locations, and other related attributes. It has 18 columns and over 100,000 entries, which will be filtered to 2024 only and sorted by coordinates closest to the Northeastern Boston Campus. The dataset is available online at Boston’s Open Data Portal, and it is able to be loaded into an analysis environment for further exploration and visualization.</p>

    <p>We filtered the dataset to focus specifically on crime incidents that occurred in 2024 and further narrowed the data to crimes reported near Northeastern University’s Boston campus using geographic coordinates.</p>
    <h4>Findings</h4>
    <h3>Gun violence in Boston has generally decreased over time, and is less prevalent in colder months</h3>
    <div class="solo">
        <iframe src="gun_metrics_over_time.html" height=600 width = 800></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>This is a line plot that tracks weekly gun-related incidents over time, providing a visual representation of trends and fluctuations. The red line connects weekly data points, showing how the number of incidents changes from week to week. Comparing the years 2023 and 2024, the plot reveals that the average number of gun-related incidents in 2024 is lower than in 2023, as seen in the reduced frequency and intensity of peaks in 2024. From January to May 2024, there is a noticeable dip in incidents, and a recurring pattern emerges where the end of each month tends to have fewer incidents compared to the middle. For students, this trend suggests a potentially safer environment in 2024 and highlights the importance of understanding these patterns to guide future safety measures and awareness campaigns.</p>
    <h3>Most gun-related crime in Boston this year happened in residential areas, and was not very common near campus.</h3>
    <div class="solo">
        <iframe src="shooting_map.html" height = 600 width = 800></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>This Folium map provides a focused visualization of shooting incidents, offering an in-depth look at where these violent events are occurring within Boston. The map makes it easier for users to find places with higher risks of firearm violence by highlighting the exact locations of gun-related crimes by filtering only for shootings. Through the interactive capabilities, viewers may zoom out to see more general trends throughout the city or zoom in for a close-up look at certain areas. Law enforcement, legislators, and community organizations may better allocate resources, create focused safety efforts, and address the underlying causes of gun violence in high-impact regions with the help of this map. By offering easily comprehensible data on the frequency and distribution of shootings, it also increases public awareness.</p>
    <h3>Crime overall was concentrated in busy, commercial neighborhoods, with violent crime mostly taking place in Back Bay.</h3>
    <div class="double">
        <iframe src="crime_map.html" height = 400 width = 600></iframe><iframe src="serious_crime_map.html" height = 400 width = 600></iframe>
    </div>
    <div class="double">
        <p>All crime</p><p>Serious crime</p>
    </div>
    <p>The interactive Folium map on the left-hand side shows all the serious and non-serious crimes in the Boston area. By precisely identifying crime scenes, viewers may quickly see where events are most common around the city. The interactive nature of the map improves its usability by enabling users to zoom out for a more comprehensive picture or zoom in for in-depth views of certain areas. Being able to move around the map also gives users freedom while examining different locations, which makes it an effective tool for locating crime hotspots. Stakeholders like law enforcement and municipal planners may also better understand spatial crime trends and develop effective intervention strategies with the help of this graphic.</p>
    <p>The right-side interactive Folium map filtered for serious crimes in Boston offers a focused view of the locations where the most critical incidents occur. By displaying only severe offenses, the map provides a clearer understanding of high-priority areas requiring attention. Since users can navigate the city or zoom in and out, it's simple to pinpoint particular neighborhoods or areas with a high concentration of significant crimes. Law enforcement organizations and policy analysts, may better prioritize resources and measures to properly handle these high-impact situations with the help of this tailored visualization. Additionally, it helps students who may not be from/familiar with the Boston area choose a safe neighborhood to live in when deciding on off-campus housing.</p>
    <h3> The types of crimes committed varied greatly between time of day, time of year, and time of the week. </h3>
    <div class="double">
        <iframe src="monthly.html" height = 600, width = 800></iframe><iframe src="hourly.html" height = 600 width = 800></iframe>

    <p>This bar chart on the right shows the amount of violent crimes, car incidents, and thefts in each month of 2023 in Boston. These crimes are tracked because they are the ones that students will have to worry about, and they need to be aware of when they happen. This graph shows the general trend that more crimes happen in the summer months, as the peak is between May and October, with the low being in december. However, aside from the outlier of December, generally crime is pretty steady throughout the months, and students should be on guard whether it is summer or winter. </p>
    <p>The hourly line graph shows the 3 types of crimes and how many have happened at each hour of the day in 2023. The most crime happened at midnight. In the morning, between 4-10am, car incidents have the highest share of the crimes, which makes sense as this is when people would be commuting to work. Until nighttime, theft is then the crime that residents should be most aware of, as it spikes between noon and 7pm, again something that makes sense as this is when people are out and about, and are at the biggest risk of theft. Lastly violent crimes have their biggest share of the pool between 11pm and 3am, again making sense as they often happen in the dark. This graph gives Boston residents a great idea of what they should be aware of during different times of the day.</p>
    <p>This line plot on the bottom shows the different crime categories and the amount of incidents on each day of the week. There isn't very much fluctuation on this one, and the only real takeaway is that there are less car incidents and theft on Sunday, and theft also decreases on Saturday as well. Violent crimes seem to be unaffected by the day of the week, as it is very consistent and hovers around 3000 for the year on each day of the week. Not a lot of information can be gained from the surface on just the days of the week graph. </p>
    <h3>Certain types of crime are more likely to happen at specific times: car related incidents, for example, usually happen between 8 and 11 AM on weekdays.</h3>
    <div class="solo">
        <iframe src = "crime_dashboard.html" height = 1200 width = 900></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>This dashboard allows you to select one of the 3 categories and for that category shows a line graph for crimes by hour of the day, heatmap for the day of week and hour, and the crimes by month. Some of the takeaways here are for Violent Crimes, there is a hotspot specifically on the weekend between midnight and 3am. The hotspot for Car incidents is between 8 and 11 am, except for Sundays, which is the opposite of the violent crimes trend. Theft has the least obvious hotspot of the 3 categories, with Tuesday between 4 and 7 pm oddly being the biggest hotspot. Theft is more consistent throughout the days and hours, Generally between 10am and 6pm no matter the day there is a high risk of theft, and also at midnight. </p>
    <h3>The dashboard below allows for an in-depth look into what types of crimes are more likely to happen at a given time.</h3>
    <div class="solo">
        <iframe src = "day_hour_dashboard.html" height = 950 width = 900></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>This dashboard combines all of the types of crimes and shows a heatmap of the days of the week and hours of the day. When you click on a box, it shows you a bar graph of the amount of crimes that happened in that timeframe on that day. This shows many interesting discrepancies, for example on Sunday at midnight the 3 categories of crime share a pretty even split, however on Wednesday at the same time there are significantly more thefts than car incidents and significantly more car incidents than violent crimes. On Wednesdays between 10-11, there were about 100 more car incidents than thefts, compare that to Tuesday at the same time and you'll see there are about 25 more thefts than car incidents. This dashboard is a powerful tool for any Boston resident concerned about their safety to know what they need to look out for, any time of day, any day of the week.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Crime patterns in Boston reveal that midnight is the most common time for crimes to occur, making late-night hours particularly high-risk. Washington Street stands out as the most dangerous location, with more serious crimes reported there than on any other street—over twice as many as its closest competitor—emphasizing the need for caution in this area. Additionally, Back Bay was home to the most violent crime in the region, so additional caution should be exercised there as well. Different types of crimes exhibit distinct patterns throughout the day: violent crimes are most prevalent at night, particularly between 11 PM and 3 AM; car incidents peak in the morning, between 4 AM and 10 AM, likely coinciding with commuter activity; and theft is most common during the day, spiking between noon and 7 PM when public activity is at its highest. Encouragingly, there have been fewer gun-related incidents in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting an improvement in safety and the potential effectiveness of ongoing interventions. In the future, the findings could be further combined, to look at more specific regions and look for heatmaps of what time of day and what types of crimes happen there, but this project gives any boston citizen a great baseline of what crime they need to be aware of, and when and where they need to be most aware.</p>
